# A Template for C/C++ Premake5 Projects
This is my custom Premake5 template for all of my C++ projects.

### Features of this template
This template has some useful Windows batch scripts to help you get started quicker:

* A script to rename your project so you don't have to manually change the name everywhere
* A configurable build script that can be called in different ways
* A clean script that makes use of prmake5 actions (YET TO BE IMPLEMENTED)

Refer to the LICENSE for usage terms.
